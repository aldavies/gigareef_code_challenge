		<h1>REMOTE TREASURE ISLAND</h1>

		<img id="island" src="img/island.jpg">

		<p2 id="p2">2000 kilometers off the coast of Africa might</br> not make Mauritius a first choice when it</br> comes to picking a tropical getaway, but its</br>remoteness is exactly what makes it well worth</br>visiting.
		</p2>

		<p3 id="p3">The island's isolated spot in the Pacific ocean and its volcanic origin</br> contributed to it being a home to some of the rarest plants and animals</br> in the world, most famously the now extinct dodo bird. Its unique</br> position also made Mauritius susceptible to the cultures of nations that</br> have ruled over it. The Portuguese, Dutch, French and the British all had</br>a big role in influencing the way Mauritians live and the multicultural</br>heritage is still alive today.</p3>
